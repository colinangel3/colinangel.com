                <h1>Notes On China</h1>
                <h2>January 5, 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    China is in many ways an enigma. A country of over a billion people, with modern cities like Beijing and Shanghai, filled with towering skyscrapers and light glinting off of curving car surfaces, fresh off the factory line, yet at the same time surrounded by a wall of hulking, lifeless apartment towers, no different than the next, with smog descending like a pall over their residents and delivery bikes whisking to and fro all hours of the day. Was I looking at the real China, or a facade? Was I to take the shopping centers and technology as the average or the exception? My belief is that both are real, but illusory in their own way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I whisked along trains at 400 kilometers per hour, miles and miles of superhighways, and multitudinous lines of metro systems, I couldn't help but be impressed with the country's infrastructure. Within minutes, one can travel to the other side of a city, within hours to the other side of the country. But as I had to remind myself, each impressive road likely belied the thousands of residents forced out of its path without remorse. A power like Robert Moses was an anomaly in shaping the cityscape of America; in China, the party could toy with whole cities without so much as a cry from the populace, because the trade was already made. They would have their roads, but not their discretion.

                <p>
                    Yet, the history and culture of China was also of an impressive magnitude. One day I met the Great Wall, expanding for 8,000 kilometers, the next the square at Tiananmen, the largest in the world, looked down upon by the portrait of Mao and his mausoleum (which naturally was constructed in 4 days). Xi'an held the Terracotta Warriors and Shanghai the shimmering Bund across the futuristic Pudong and its Tower. Multitudes of Chinese tourists were omnipresent at every attraction, nevermind the workweek. As an American, I felt lied to. The China I was seeing had all of the first-world trappings I'd grown accustomed to. The people I viewed seemed prosperous. What was I missing?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Military Museum, I gained an inkling. The ground floor section was devoted to a de-facto worship of Xi Jinping and the Party: its strength, its wisdom, its infallibility. In temples, signs stood as a reminder that yes, one was free to practice their religion, at the courtesy of the Party, so long as that religion wouldn't dare to subvert the Party's principles. The trains whisked us quickly through the countryside, but perhaps to keep us from glancing too long at the factory towns and rural hovels, surrounded again by those hulking, depressive apartment blocks, many without lights to signal a single dweller's presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For every prosperous tourist I encountered, how many more were delivering food or assembling mobile devices for 14, 15, or 16 hours a day for a mere pittance, lives interrupted by a brief sleep. How many of the taxi drivers did we see with no entertainment beyond the videos scrolling before their sunken eyes, merely to distract them from the neverending road? The economic numbers tell of a newfound prosperity; the wealth of the few suggest an ascendant nation. But where was the many? What stories did they have to tell?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In China, physical poverty has been greatly reduced. Many people are no longer fearful of hunger or thirst. Social media and constant phone use keeps harsh thoughts away. But when the dust settles, the smog clears, and the train comes to its destination, will they see clearly the spiritual and mental poverty enforced by their regime, or was what I saw just a dream?
