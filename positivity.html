                    The relative forces of nature and nurture act from an early age to develop each person into who they are at their current state. Surely, some amount of genetic influences are reflected in a person’s general personality and perspective towards their external environment. Even more so, an off-putting experience with a classmate or friend can push a person to adopt a default cynicism without much recognition of its development.

                    The human brain is wired to value suboptimal outcomes over positive ones- indeed, loss aversion is a foundational tenet of behavioral psychology. However, this bias has a certain chilling effect on human relationships I find rather unfortunate, especially in a time when negative discourse is routinely lobbed over the Internet.

                    Personally, I believe loss aversion was a significant contributor to the anxiety I developed in interacting with people in my youth. A subconscious cynicism about another’s opinion of me acted as a sort of defense mechanism as my mind predicted an unfavorable expected value if I were to interact with them.

                    As I’ve grown older, I’ve realized cynicism is more of an indictment of the cynic than the person they behold. It’s a projection of past events onto future results or internal biases on independent individuals.

                    A significantly more productive approach I’ve discovered is a default expectation to encounter the fundamental goodness of people. It’s a view in line with Adlerian psychology, which I find quite profound. Give others the benefit of the doubt, until they prove you otherwise. Although there are bound to be some occasions of suffering or embarrassment resulting from this outlook, the gifts of the new opportunities, learnings, and relationships to come are well worth it.
