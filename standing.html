                    The upcoming presidential election is unprecedented for myriad reasons. Donald Trump is a former real estate developer, convicted felon, and (checks notes) current favorite in betting markets to return to office. Kamala Harris is a Democrat of the Biden mold, serving as his replacement on the top of the ticket, with major differences as a younger, multiracial, and female candidate.

                    However, none of their respective backgrounds and policy positions are as important as their respective views on the state of democracy and the sanctity of our elections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The facts are clear. There was no evidence of systemic voter fraud or irregularities in the 2020 Presidential Election. Yet, on November 5th of that year, just two days after Election Day, Donald Trump stood in the White House Briefing Room, a symbol of accountability and First Amendment rights, and delivered among the most damaging remarks to the right of citizens to vote in the history of our country. These rambling, incoherent, and petulant exclamations of the defeated candidate were often softened into anodyne mush by his supporters, but the intent was manifestly clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What followed was the most aggressive effort in modern American history to engineer an election victory contrary to the will of the voters, as rendered by not only the popular vote but also the projected Electoral College outcome. Fake elector slates were machinated; lawsuits were filed. Texas representatives at the state and federal levels, most notably Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott, acceded to the movement. However, every case was struck down. Every false accusation was put to rest. The matter was closed.

                    On January 6, 2021, I returned home from school, turned on the television, and watched in horror as our most esteemed institution, the very halls of Congress, were infiltrated by a radical mob, incited by an online echochamber sustained by alternative facts and conspiracy theories. I recalled the first time I stepped foot into that Capitol, under its grand rotunda, and imagined the enormous progress our country had made from the service of brave statesmen who had deliberated in its towering walls. But on that day, a cowardice beyond compare ruled, as those who endorsed the ideology of the attack hid in fear or rested idly as the blood of the common man’s representatives risked being spilled on the floor, as faced by the 140 law enforcement officers injured in their protection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the resolve of our Vice President and representatives loyal to the fundamental precepts of our country, the victory of Joe Biden was certified, in spite of this attack and the personal danger they experienced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But this resolve faded for the majority of Republicans, who failed to convict Trump in his second impeachment and continue to tacitly or even overtly support his claims about the previous election, voter fraud, and the attack on our Capitol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, the machine of misinformation to challenge a free and fair election is building in preparation for Election Day. If past is prologue, expect a declaration of victory from the Republican candidate regardless of the validated statistics presented to millions of households across the country. Whether Trump accomplishes a true victory or not, our democracy will endure yet another great injury. But in the face of an organized campaign to challenge the will of the people, which we hold so dear, will the principles of our republic stand in the hearts of our representatives, leaders, and judges?

                    As Abraham Lincoln remarked in 1859, a divisive time of our nation’s history, “The people – the people – are the rightful masters of both congresses and courts – not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As political advertisements flood the airwaves with recriminations about economic issues, immigration, candidate personality, and a host of other topics, I ask you to consider which of these issues can be addressed if the voice of the people is unheard. The gravest sin against democracy, the violation of the foundational social contract on which the United States stands, will be violated.
                </p>
