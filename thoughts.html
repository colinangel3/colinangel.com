                <p>
                    Opportunities are everywhere if one can just see the world with fresh eyes. The status quo is taken for granted. The dreams of youth so often fizzle away, remembered as an ephemeral passion of bygone days. What is the limiting factor? The influence of society, namely to fit into the container of normality, has a certain strength. But self-limitation is the root of it all. The sustenance of the first trappings of status, prestige, and wealth ensnare the talented in a comfortable state. How can it be avoided? Remember that so little is retained of the vast majority of history. You are unlikely to be much more than a footnote at best- unless you show some daring. Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
